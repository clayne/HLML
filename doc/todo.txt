BEFORE RELEASE:
- move from Travis CI to GitHub Actions
	- consolidate linux build scripts like what we did for windows
	- update CI to use latest version of clang

POST RELEASE:
- add more tests:
	- constructor tests for each different constructor for vectors and matrices
	- assignment operator tests
	- array access operators
- assembly optimisations for ALL functions
- float16 support?
- investigate using ODIN as glue code solution
- why are some tests taking a lot longer than other versions of exactly the same test?
